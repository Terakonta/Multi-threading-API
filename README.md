# Multi-threading-API
Multi-threading API implemented in C using ucontext (It was part of a university assignment)

Wrote a multi-threading API for x86 architecture with my own implementation of threads, queues, mutex, conditional variables and context-switching functions without using makecontext or swapcontext
